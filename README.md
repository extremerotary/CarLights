# CarLights
I was asked how to connect an arduino to car brake and indicator (turn signal) lights so a string of LEDs could be used instead of the bulbs. In the video I talk about 3 ways in which you could do this using a Zener diode, Schottky diode or Optoisolator to change the 12V signals from the car to 5V Arduino-safe signals. Code and schemtics can be found in this repository.
